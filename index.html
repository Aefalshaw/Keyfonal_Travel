            <h1>Seasonal Travel</h1>
            <p>Traveling during the holidays can be crazy! But here are some of the best times to travel for different reasons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>June to August (busy season but great weather)</li>
                <li>Novemebr to March (slower season near beaches)</li>
                <li>March to May (early spring can be quite less busy)</li>
                <li>Summer (biggest time of travel but not in unexpected places)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depending on when you want to travel, there's a season for everyone.</p>
            <p>If you prefer the winter months to get away, perhaps rent a cabin in woods for week.</p>
            <p>If you'd rather be on the beach, Hawaii is warm almost all year round, perhaps try their slower time of the year.</p>
            <p>If your looking to get away for Christmas, make sure you book early!</p>
